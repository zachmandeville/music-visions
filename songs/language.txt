I will hold fast to language, because in language culture is preserverd.  Worldviews are articulated.  The world is not made by humans, but our understanding of the world is, as our understanding is carried forth by language.

The forcing of another lanugage is the forcing of a worldview.  colonization no longer requires physical space.  colonization can happen entirely in the digital.  The suprresion of a culture through the forced assimilation of another.
