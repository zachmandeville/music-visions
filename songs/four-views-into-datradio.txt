Datradio as boombox. A simple player page, with the personal collection of this radio owner on the left.  All of their subscribed to playlists are here--some are personal albums they uploaded, but don't want to share. Some are new mixes or albums they are listening to, but unsure if they like yet.  The color of the player is the exact color they want.  The size of the player is the exact size they want.  Maybe they've put in their own keyboard shortcuts?  There's a description that's just theirs, a song lyric placed beneath the site title.  When they put in a new dat link, the background of the player changes--it takes on the background color chosen by the playlist owner.  A new description appears below of the dat.  There are photos that appear at the bottom to scroll through. 
For as long as they are listening to this playlist, the screen will take on the appearance of it.  The closest comparison would be a turntable, with your own stickers and set up, but when you put on a record you stand the sleeve up and place it atop, the visual signifying the source of the sound.

The view of the artist, who wants to upload their latest album or mix.  They are navigating between a file structure and the dat instance, and making sure their specific playlist has the colors, shape, appearance, and tracklisting that they want.  They are not concerned with the larger collection, just the shape of this particular datarchive.  They work through a file of all their tracks, putting in lyrics and information for each one.  They upload all the art they want...the photos and notes and lyrics...into a folder of media.  They check out the dat and find the right font they want, and the color pallette.  There's a mixture of adjustment..some down in the CSS and some done in our editing tool.  Host it on their raspberry pi, wait for the seeds to start.

Going over to someone's house for the first time.  They have a dat up on their computer...completetly different view than the one you know.  There's something bare about seeing this, that excites you.  Being in someone's room,The view of the explorer and voyeur, who is visiting their friend's datradio.  They see their album in the collection....or something else.  Nah, stay with the vulnerable.  There is not one platform.  That offering of seeing someone's own site, letting you choose from their list. All of this cementing that you are in <em>their room</em>, sitting on <em>their</em> bed.  A bed that was made, but sorta hastily made, as if they realized they wanted you to come in.  And you are seeing <em>their</em> datradio.

Later on, you ask for the link to their view and you see it as everyone else does.  There are only the public playlists, and the color and view is a bit different.  There's a player, and a list of playlists/albums and a short stence of their feelings for each one.  You've seen both faces now.

 So they browse through the friend's list of playlists, and find ones that look interesting.  If they click on one, and the first song is great, and the appearance of that playlist is ownderful, then they'll copy the link and add it to their own personal collection.  In this case, the view into the friend's collection is likely different from the friend's own view, but v. similar.  In the way that the tapes you display in your room is different than the walkman you have on you.

The curator, cleaning up their public shelf.  Adding a playlist that wasn't there before, but mentioned during the date.  and a small inside joke that only they'll see.  Because when you are in love all things are meaningful, and all things can be messages.  The shirt you wore because they one time said it looked nice on you, the bed you made hastily to show you had your shit together, the toe of your shoe you placed intentionally against the toe of theirs, how you pressed them together when you both laughed at the table next to you.  The text message they sent the next morning, describing their view on the walk home.  The inside joke you add to the bottom of the album they sent you, that you added to your public shelf, showing that you listened to it, that it's a newfound favorite.
