Hello again, reader friend!  It is still me, Zach!, the author of all these words...at least, I think.  This datzine may have reached you through a friend of a friend of a friend and, by the nature of this new space we are in, it may have transformed during travel.  

~~*

I cannot guarantee that the dat archive you are reading from is the same one I wrote to.  I cannot guarantee that the words I wrote weren\'t deleted or transformed by someone else.  I can\'t even be sure that you know who I am.  There may not be a Zach in your extended network of friends, so my presence as an author and friend could be gone now too.  

But if you are reading any part of these words, then I know the general spirit and intent of my original datzine have persisted, and that's good enough for me.

~~*

To help explain what I mean, let\'s have another vulnerable thought experiment!  But this time, reader, you will not just be the friend I share this link to.  You'll also become the friend of friend, then the friend of friend of friend, and then back to who you actually are right now.  

The analogy will also transform from zine, to story, to song.

I\'ll stay Zach throughout.  

Let\'s begin!

~~*

One of the beauties of zines is that they are ephemeral.  There may only be  as many copies as the zinester printed, and each copy is only as strong as its paper, binding, and the care given to it by the reader.  

Imagine you are given a strange little zine by a friend, and there is a title but no author is given.  You read it again and again, and love it, but one day it is accidentally thrown out with a pile of old mail.  

There is no easy way to bring this zine back, no store to buy it from again.  You now only have the memory, a description you can  give to friends, to see if they heard of it and could point you to another copy.

~~*

Now let\'s say that you are the first reader of this datzine: I shared the link to you and no one else.  This datzine, then, is as ephemeral as its paper twin.  You can visit the archive and read its various tracks for as long as I have my computer up and running, and as long as I have this folder _on_ my computer.

Perhaps something terribly stupid happens, and I accidentally throw out this computer with a pile of old mail.  This whole datzine, then, is gone with it.  The datlink points directly to a file on my computer, which is available when I am online, and so now that dat link would provide nothing but a memory..

~~*

It\'s too much pressure to have this whole zine reliant upon my computer and my internet connection.  I want the zine to persist beyond my single person and device.  Luckily, with Dat, I can use preservation methods that are stronger than what any central server could provide.  I am talking, of course, of friendship and storytelling.

~~*

You are still the first reader, but now you think, \'ah shit, this is good.  I wanna support what Zach did here.\' You click the star icon in the address bar and now you are \'seeding\' this archive.  Seeding is a term coming from the torrenting world, and is useful to describe what our computers are doing with the files but it\'s not as useful for describing what _we_ are doing.

~~*

The writing held in this archive is coming from my heart.  When I shared it with you, and kept my computer up and open for you to read it, I was speaking my heart to you for as long as I could maintain my connection.  When you starred the archive, you started broadcasting the same archive but from your computer.  So now either of us could be online, and the same datlink could be accessible.  In essence, you added your voice in support of mine, reciting the same words from your computer so that mine could rest.

~~*

Even more magically, I could still be mad stupid and throw my computer into the recycling, and this datzine would persist because of you.  I had an idea that I shared with you, which you supported and decided to share with others, so that even when I'm not around my idea would persists. This is how stories persist among friends even after they are separated by distance and time and is the essence of how dat works.

Well, almost. There's another element to Dat that makes it stronger than a memorized story, that moves away from just \'seeding\' into a full \'living tradition\'.
