Streaming is a method of listening to music, much like the method listening on tape, or vinyl, or cd.  We can choose whoever we want to go with for our tape pressing or vinyl making, but that doesn't change the method in which we distribute and deliver the music.  For streaming though, the company decides how it's distributed.  We choose between a small number of providers, and our fans <em>have</em> to choose one of them to listen and then are locked in to them, essentially.  This makes little sense.

We must own the means of distribution.  There are so many diverse physical methods, the style of play is imnportant. Not the way you chooose to distribute that style.  Like--people will want to listen to a tape, or a cd, or a record.  And, if they big ol' audiophiles, they may appreciate a certain thickness of vinyl or quality of tape.  But there are few, if zero, people who would say 'I only listen to bands who press vinyl specifically with VinylCo. Pressing plant.  And I only listen to bands who use RCA-DVI for distribution.  If that 180gram vinyl came to me through any other means, than fucking NO way will I listen.

That concept is absurd, but it's a value we've been forced into adapting through digital music.  People ultimately want to stream music, or listen to it all on a single device instead of having to swtich out hard packages.  But the streaming type of play has become fully intertwined with the distribution methods of that particular streaming file.  You choose whether you want to be on spotify or google play or Tidal or deezer or whatever shit, and then you mostly only listen to bands that are licensed there.  And if you are a band, you make sure you are distributed with these channels, even if they don't agree with yo ur values, because you want people to be able to hear your music.

Band sshould own the means for distribution, while still being able to be in the preent moment.  Autonomy doesn't have to mean adapting older styles only.  You should be able to have a tape, vinyl, cd, mpp3, and streaming and have autonomy over each.  We are in the future, that's entirely possible.
