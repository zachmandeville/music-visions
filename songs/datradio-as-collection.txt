 So they browse through the friend's list of playlists, and find ones that look interesting.  If they click on one, and the first song is great, and the appearance of that playlist is ownderful, then they'll copy the link and add it to their own personal collection.  In this case, the view into the friend's collection is likely different from the friend's own view, but v. similar.  In the way that the tapes you display in your room is different than the walkman you have on you.

The curator, cleaning up their public shelf.  Adding a playlist that wasn't there before, but mentioned during the date.  and a small inside joke that only they'll see.  Because when you are in love all things are meaningful, and all things can be messages.  The shirt you wore because they one time said it looked nice on you, the bed you made hastily to show you had your shit together, the toe of your shoe you placed intentionally against the toe of theirs, how you pressed them together when you both laughed at the table next to you.  The text message they sent the next morning, describing their view on the walk home.  The inside joke you add to the bottom of the album they sent you, that you added to your public shelf, showing that you listened to it, that it's a newfound favorite.
