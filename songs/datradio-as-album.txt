You are becoming nocturnal.  There is something poetic you could say about the moon, and the different light on the leaves outside bringing out a different emotion in your songs.  That you _feel_ lunar and so should write what you feel.  All those things are _kinda_ true, but really it's just embarassing every time your family asks if you're writing 'luuurve songs', and you'd rather wait until they are asleep and avoid any questions.

as the house quiets and settles your tiny studio comes to life.  It is as tiny as a bedroom closet; it is your bedroom closet.  You've pulled all the clothes out to reveal the eggfoam stapled to the ceiling and wall, the keyboard you got last birthday propped in one corner, next to a pillow pilfered from the upstairs couch.  You sit cross-legged on the pillow with the casio on your lap, cords wrapped around you and plugged into the laptop glowing in the closet corner.

You checked that your headphones were plugged in, and all the digital toggles of the recording software Jackie had taught you looked the way she said they should look.

Then you pulled out the last letter she sent you, with all its confusing open-ended sentiments and cruelly vague last sentence.  You read it one more time, close your eyes, and play.

Everything you want to tell her is in these 10 songs.  You've spent all of autumn on it, re-shaping every lyric and pattern.  And tonight you've added the final note.  You listen back to it, that rising swell of synth that takes over where your voice ends, and wavers in a pure all of you chord before it too fades and the song falls into silence and fuck it sounds good.  Like, it sounds just like Baths and you're pacing and skipping around your room cos it sounds like  Baths and she'll love it.  Everyone who hears this will love it and you're going to be huge, you think as you fall asleep on your clothes, head in the closet, headphones still on.
