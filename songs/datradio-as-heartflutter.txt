Going over to someone's house for the first time.  They have a dat up on their computer...completetly different view than the one you know.  There's something bare about seeing this, that excites you.  Being in someone's room,The view of the explorer and voyeur, who is visiting their friend's datradio.  They see their album in the collection....or something else.  Nah, stay with the vulnerable.  There is not one platform.  That offering of seeing someone's own site, letting you choose from their list. All of this cementing that you are in <em>their room</em>, sitting on <em>their</em> bed.  A bed that was made, but sorta hastily made, as if they realized they wanted you to come in.  And you are seeing <em>their</em> datradio.

Later on, you ask for the link to their view and you see it as everyone else does.  There are only the public playlists, and the color and view is a bit different.  There's a player, and a list of playlists/albums and a short stence of their feelings for each one.  You've seen both faces now.
