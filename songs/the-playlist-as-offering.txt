You seek out songs and bands to explore your own history and place.  The details of a narrative you feel called to own.
~~*
Songs often hold our first experience with an emotion, a tremble, a hue of a color you could name but not see.  You are reminded of  your personal introduction to these feelings when you hear those songs again. And so our favorite songs are like droplets of amber, containing a reflection of the place you heard them, the time you heard them.  They contain a reflection of you.
~~*
And so, the gift of a mixtape is a literal offering of yourself.  the mixtape is a form of oral storytelling, like the folktales of old that act as song, lesson, and map all at once.
~~*
The myths that contain maps, the myths whose style and rhythm of telling are important for within that is held a map.
