title: some context

post:

It is 11:50 at night.  I am in a mint-green room, with thick muslin curtains, on top of a mountain in New Zealand.  But I'm also feeling homesick and wistful and listening to Bright Eyes.   I have a window open, to let the wonderfully crisp night air in.  Exotic moths keep finding their way into my room, drawn by the light of this computer screen.  They crawl for a minute over these words then fly back out again.
