We will polish and sculpt datradio and want to share it widely, and the first batch of feedback will include:

\"Is this a spotify alternative?\" 

Or, \"What are you going to do to really take out spotify?\" 

Or, \"You\'re going to need a lot more features if you want to take on itunes.\"

Please listen to none of this.

I wanna urge you to listen to none of this. They are positioning an argument that is absurd and damaging--this notion that we are trying to 'replace' a shitty thing, to assume it's spot, and to do so we should have feature parity with that shitty thing.

That's like someone listing to the music on the radio and saying, 'All of this music sucks, I guess I'll just have to start a band to make music I wanna hear.  And I beter make sure my music recreactes this radio song exactly...it's gotta have hooks, a bridge, an overlong guitar solo.  But, y'know, this time <em>i'm</em> the one wanking.
