This site is a mix of my thoughts on the future, memories, favorite albums, feelings i wanna express but cannot quite articulate, and some practical roadmapping.  There is some mention of good features or things to build, but it is largely a collage of tones that I hope gives forth an idea of where datradio could go.  I realized that a lot of these feelings were based on what dat itself represented, and so I talk about dat in general with datradio as the hidden heart of all my feelings.

There are practical thoughts within here, I hope, but none are expressed that directly. This is partly just a personal hurdle, that I have a hard time with 'linear thought', but it's also that I didn't want to narrow the possibilities of datradio by trying to construct a logical argument for an emotional state. 

~~*

I am presenting to you the big prairie of my heart, each future feeling  its own special blade of grass, but they sway together into one amber ocean.
